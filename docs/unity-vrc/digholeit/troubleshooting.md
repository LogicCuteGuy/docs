# Troubleshooting

> Documentation version: **0.6.1**

**A gray strip or gap shows through the terrain next to a zone.**
The terrain has a hole that no zone covers, usually left by an older bake. Holes from deleted zones can be filled with **Fix Leftover Holes** in the terrain tools. For a hole no zone knows about, open the terrain's **Paint Holes** tool and paint the area back in, then bake the zone again.

**The bake fails with "too small" or "Border Voxels is too large".**
The terrain hole is cut one voxel inside the zone edge, and Border Voxels is kept untouched inside it. Make the zone wider than about 7 voxels in X and Z, or lower Border Voxels to 2–3.

**"Settings changed since the last bake" in the inspector.**
The zone's position, cells, voxel size or chunk cells changed. Click **Bake**. Sculpting and paint are kept unless the voxel size changed or the zone moved off its lattice; the message says which.

**The zone didn't follow a terrain edit.**
Check that **Follow terrain edits** is on in the zone inspector, and that the zone is baked and up to date. Zones only update after the brush stroke ends.

**Standalone scripts show as "Missing Script" in a VRChat project.**
That's expected: the standalone runtime only compiles outside VRChat projects. Add the `DIGHOLEIT_STANDALONE` scripting define if you need it.

**Edits don't sync in VRChat.**
Make sure the zone has a VRChat runtime (**Add VRChat Runtime** in the zone inspector), that `DigZoneRuntime.sync` points at its `DigSync`, and that `DigSync` is on its own GameObject. Remove the runtime and add it again to recreate both.

**"The grid is too large".**
A zone can have at most 128 Mi samples. Fit To Terrain makes the box as tall as the terrain under it, so a zone across a hill or cliff gets very tall. Make the zone smaller and put it only where players dig, split it into several zones, or use bigger voxels (twice the voxel size is an eighth of the samples).

**The scene has thousands of Chunk objects, or saving is slow.**
Zones baked by older versions have an object and a mesh for every chunk, even empty ones. Click **Bake** (sculpting and paint are kept): only chunks with a surface keep an object.

**The dig tool doesn't hit the zone.**
Include the zone's Chunk Layer in the tool's `layers` mask, and check that `reach` is long enough.

**The zone is dark or unlit with baked lights.**
Lights set to Baked only reach lightmapped objects and light probes. Keep **Baked Lighting** on for the zone, click **Add Light Probes**, and bake lighting again (after the zone's last Bake or sculpt). Dug chunks use the probes.

**Dark lines on the terrain along the zone edge, or the zone takes a lot of lightmap space.**
Zones baked before 0.4.0 have chunk meshes that reach past the terrain hole and a Scale In Lightmap of 1. Bake the zone again (the meshes are cut to the hole), then bake lighting (the chunks take the terrain's Scale In Lightmap, at least 16 texels across a chunk, times the zone's **Lightmap Scale**).

**A square grid shows in the baked lighting of a zone.**
Each chunk has its own lightmap, so chunks with few texels show their edges. Raise the zone's **Lightmap Scale** and bake lighting again.

**A dug area looks too bright or too dark.**
Dug chunks are lit by light probes above the ground and darkened with depth. Tune **Darkening Below Surface** and **Darkening Depth** on the zone material.

**The voxel surface looks gray or untextured.**
Click **Apply Material** to refill the material from the terrain layers. After adding terrain layers, Bake the zone so it gets their splat maps. DigTerrain Lite shades up to 8 layers.

**Trees are missing from the terrain where a zone is (zones baked before 0.5.0).**
A terrain deletes the trees in its holes. Zones baked by older versions didn't keep them, so those trees are gone from the terrain data. Paint them again with **DigHoleIt: Paint Trees**; zones now keep the trees in their hole and give them back when the hole is filled.

**Unity's Paint Trees or Paint Details does nothing inside a zone.**
The terrain can't be hit through its hole, and it refuses trees there. Use **DigHoleIt: Paint Trees** / **DigHoleIt: Paint Details** in the Paint Terrain list: the same brushes, reaching inside zones too. If DigHoleIt: Paint Trees places nothing, select a tree in its list first (and for details, add a detail with **Edit Details** and select it).

**No tool paints details on the demo terrain.**
A terrain made by script starts without a detail map (**Detail Resolution** 0); the demo terrain of DigHoleIt 0.4.0 and earlier is one. Neither Unity's Paint Details nor DigHoleIt: Paint Details can paint on it. Set **Detail Resolution** in the terrain's Settings (Mesh Resolution), or click **Set Detail Resolution To 512** in DigHoleIt: Paint Details.

**Trees painted with Unity's Paint Trees ignore Tree Height and Tree Width.**
Unity's terrain doesn't scale a tree's transform: it passes the size to the tree's shader, and only the Nature (Tree Creator, Soft Occlusion) and SpeedTree shaders use it. A prefab with the Standard shader, or most other shaders, is drawn at full size whatever the height and width, and the prefab root's scale is ignored too. Inside zones the trees are copies of the prefab scaled by their transform, so they follow the height and width. To size terrain trees, use a Nature or SpeedTree shader on the prefab, or scale the model itself (its import Scale Factor).

**Trees or grass are missing inside a zone.**
Check **Trees** / **Details** on the zone, and that the zone is baked. Details beyond the terrain's **Detail Distance** aren't drawn. Trees and details are removed where the ground under them was dug away or built over; **Reset To Terrain** (editor) or a runtime reset brings them back.

**Baking raised the top of my zone.**
The terrain reached the top of the box, which would cut the surface off flat. Bake raises the top to **Headroom Above Terrain** over the highest terrain point and logs it. Lower Headroom Above Terrain for a flatter box.
