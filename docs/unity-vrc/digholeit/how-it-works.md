## Grid

- One byte per sample, `(cells.x+1)·(cells.y+1)·(cells.z+1)` samples.
- Each byte is a signed distance to the surface in 1/64 voxel, clamped to ±2 voxels. Values below 128 are solid.
- The data asset stores two copies: the current grid and the grid as baked from the terrain. Re-bakes and terrain follow compare the two to tell sculpted samples from untouched ones.

## Compression

Grids are saved run-length encoded (`DigRle`, `DigRleEncoder`): a varint sample count, then tokens that are either a run (length and one value) or literal bytes. Only runs of 8 or more are stored as runs, which keeps the token count low. A terrain grid is mostly solid (0) or air (255) with a thin surface band, so it shrinks to a few percent.

- `DigZoneData` saves the encoded grids and decodes them when the asset loads. It re-encodes only when a grid array is replaced or `gridVersion` is bumped, so code that edits a grid in place must bump `gridVersion`.
- `DigZoneRuntime` stores the grid per chunk (`DigChunkPacker`): each chunk's samples plus one sample on every side, which is all its mesh reads, encoded separately and joined into one blob with an offset per chunk. A chunk whose samples are all equal (all solid or all air) stores no stream, just its value. Udon decodes a chunk with `Array.Copy` per token (and log2(n) copies per run) the first time an edit reaches it.
- Neighbouring chunks share their border samples. Every edit is stamped into each chunk copy it reaches, so the copies stay identical and chunks still meet without cracks. Reset drops the decoded chunks and puts the baked meshes back.
- In the editor, sculpt strokes mark the sample box they changed (`DigZoneData.MarkChanged`), so only those chunks are encoded again when the runtime is updated.

## Paint grid

One byte per sample, same layout: 0 auto, 1–4 terrain layers 0–3, 5 dug soil, 6–17 terrain layers 4–15 (layers 0–3 and dug soil kept the values of earlier versions). A zone that was never painted stores no paint grid in the scene.

## Edits

An edit is packed into one `long`:

- position in 1/16 voxel;
- radius in 1/8 voxel;
- op (dig, add, paint);
- paint layer.

Dig is `max(d, -sphere)` and Add is `min(d, sphere)`. Paint sets the layer inside the sphere. All three are idempotent, so applying an edit twice changes nothing. Edits only touch samples inside the zone's edit box, at least Border Voxels inside the terrain hole.

## Meshing

- Naive Surface Nets, one mesh per chunk.
- Normals come from the SDF gradient, so chunk borders have no lighting seams.
- Each quad is split along its shorter diagonal, which avoids saw-tooth folds on sharp rims.
- Paint becomes per-vertex weights, interpolated over the cell's corners. Each chunk mesh has 4 paint slots: the first 4 terrain layers painted in the chunk. Vertex colour holds the slot weights, uv0.x the dug soil weight, and uv0.y the slots' terrain layers (4 bits each, the same on every vertex of the chunk). Meshes from earlier versions have 0 there, which reads as slots = layers 0–3.
- `Runtime/Shared` is registered as an UdonSharp assembly. LCGUdonSharp compiles the same static methods into Udon that the C# runtime calls directly.

## Shading

`DigHoleIt/DigTerrain` blends the terrain's layers (up to 16) from the baked splat maps (`_Control` for layers 0–3, `_Control1`–`_Control3` for the rest), with triplanar mapping and normal maps. Bake enables the `_DIGLAYERS_8`, `_DIGLAYERS_12` or `_DIGLAYERS_16` keyword for the terrain's layer count. A layer is only sampled where its weight is above zero, with explicit gradients so the branches don't disturb mipmapping, and all layer textures share one sampler. Below the original surface (from the baked height map) it uses the dug soil material, and darkens ambient light with depth. The shader clips the mesh outside the terrain hole, so the voxel surface meets the terrain edge exactly.

`DigHoleIt/DigTerrain Lite` is a Lambert version for Quest: up to 8 layers, each sampled once on the dominant axis plane, no normal maps. Mobile GPUs have 16 texture units, so on mobile the Standard shader shades only the first 4 layers; use Lite there.

## Lighting

Chunk objects are marked Contribute GI, Reflection Probe Static and Occludee Static when the zone's Baked Lighting is on (never Batching Static, since their meshes change, or Occluder Static, since digging opens views through the ground), and their meshes get lightmap UVs. Runtimes switch a chunk to light probes (`lightmapIndex = -1`) when they replace its mesh, and restore the baked lightmap index and scale/offset on reset. Chunks created at runtime are copies of the Chunk Template, which is never lightmapped.

## Trees and details

A terrain draws no trees or details in its holes and deletes the trees there, so zones handle both (`DigFoliageBaker`):

- When a zone cuts its hole it moves the terrain's trees inside it into `DigZoneData.terrainTrees` and gives them back when the hole is filled (`DigTerrainHoles`). Each kept tree gets a copy of its prefab.
- Detail instances come from `TerrainData.ComputeDetailInstanceTransforms` on a hole-free copy of the terrain's detail layers, so they land where the terrain would put them. They are merged into one mesh per chunk column, drawn with `DigHoleIt/DigDetail`.
- Everything has an anchor: details the top surface of their grid column when they were built, trees the point they stand on. Something stands while the SDF at its anchor (interpolated between the two samples around it for details, trilinear over the grid cell around it for trees, so they can stand on walls) is within `DigFoliage.Tolerance` (24/64 voxel) of zero, so it goes when the surface under it is dug away or built over.
- The foliage mask (`DigFoliage`, one RGBA32 texel per grid column) holds each column's anchor (g, b) and whether its details stand (r). Surface details (`DigZoneData.surfaceDetails`: walls, cave ceilings) get one texel each in rows above the columns, and their anchors are points like the trees' (`DigZone.surfaceDetailAnchors`, sorted by chunk in `surfaceDetailBuckets`). Every detail vertex carries its instance root (uv3) and its column's mask texel (uv2), and the shader collapses instances whose column has r = 0. Trees are switched off.
- Each anchor is checked by one chunk: for details the one holding its column and the sample below it, for trees the one holding the grid cell around it (`DigFoliageBaker.AnchorChunk`). After meshing a chunk, the VRChat runtime checks the details and trees it holds from its own samples (a few columns per step, inside the frame budget). Trees are sorted by that chunk (`treeBuckets`).

`DigFoliageSync` rebuilds a zone's trees and details when the terrain's trees, details or prototypes change (`ObjectChangeEvents`) or after undo, if their hash (`DigZoneData.foliageSignature`) changed. When only the trees changed (`foliageDetailSignature` still matches), only the trees are rebuilt.

## Udon frame budget

Queued edits and meshing share `budgetMsDesktop` (2.5 ms) or `budgetMsMobile` (1.2 ms) per frame. The chunk nearest the player is meshed first.

## Networking

`DigSync` keeps an ordered, append-only edit log:

1. The digging player applies the edit locally right away (prediction) and asks the owner to append it.
2. The owner assigns the next sequence number and broadcasts the edit (`[NetworkCallable]`).
3. Every client applies edits strictly in sequence order and buffers any that arrive early. Re-applying the predicted edit changes nothing, because edits are idempotent.
4. Shortly after someone joins, the owner serializes the full log (Manual sync), and the late joiner replays it, time-sliced.
5. Every client keeps the full log, so an ownership handoff keeps working.

`_RequestReset()` starts a new epoch: everyone restores the baked grid and the log is cleared.

## Editor side

- `DigZoneBaker` bakes zones and raises `Baked` and `GridChanged`. It creates chunk objects only for chunks with a surface, plus an inactive Chunk Template that runtimes copy when a chunk gains one; sculpting in the editor adds objects the same way. In VRChat projects, `DigUdonBridge` listens and copies the per-chunk data into the zone's `DigZoneRuntime`, if it has one. `DigZoneEditor.RuntimeGUI` is where the runtimes draw their Add/Remove buttons.
- `DigTerrainSync` listens to `TerrainCallbacks.heightmapChanged` and `textureChanged` and calls `DigZoneBaker.SyncWithTerrain` once a stroke ends. After undo or redo it re-syncs only zones whose terrain heights or layer blend under them changed (it keeps a hash of both).
- Undo and redo deserialize the whole `DigZoneData`. Grids whose encoding didn't change keep their decoded arrays (unless they were changed in place since they were encoded). `DigSculptUndo` compares the new arrays with the ones the meshes were made from and remeshes only the chunks around the difference; `DigZoneData.AdoptUndo` keeps the VRChat runtime's per-chunk streams, so only those chunks are encoded again.
- `DigTerrainHoles` records which terrain cells each zone cut, and fills them back in when zones are deleted, together with the trees the zone kept. A re-bake gives the trees back and takes them again; `KeepPlacement` puts back each one's height and direction (`DigTreeInstance.up`).
- A bake raises the zone's top when the terrain reaches it (`DigZoneBaker.GrowToTerrain`).
- `DigTerrainTreeTool` and `DigTerrainDetailTool` wrap Unity's Paint Trees and Paint Details tools: where the mouse ray hits a zone's voxel surface before the terrain, they paint there (details through Unity's tool at that terrain spot, trees into the zone's list). The tree brush scatters on the plane of the surface under the mouse and drops each tree onto the voxel surface along its normal (`DigGridUtil.Raycast`); the detail tool snapshots the detail layers under the brush and puts back cells whose surface is further than the brush radius from the mouse in height.
