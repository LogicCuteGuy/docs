# Editor brushes

> Documentation version: **0.5.0**

There are two ways to sculpt and paint a baked zone in the editor. Both use the same brush settings.

- **From the Terrain:** Terrain component > Paint Terrain > **DigHoleIt: Dig Voxels** (Dig, Add, Smooth, Reset) or **DigHoleIt: Paint Voxels**. The brush shape comes from Unity's terrain brush list. The brush works on every baked zone that uses the terrain.
- **From the zone:** select the Dig Zone and click **Sculpt Tool**. An overlay in the Scene view has the modes (Dig, Add, Paint, Smooth, Reset), the paint layer, and the shape (Sphere, Soft, Flat or a custom mask texture).

## Modes

| Mode | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Dig** | Pushes the surface in, like the terrain Lower brush. Aim at a wall to dig a tunnel. |
| **Add** | Pulls the surface out, like the terrain Raise brush. |
| **Paint** | Sets the layer of the voxels inside the brush. Lower strength thins it out so layers blend. |
| **Smooth** | Evens out the surface under the brush. |
| **Reset** | Brushes voxels back to the terrain they were baked from and wipes their paint. Lower strength does it gradually. |

Dig, Add, Smooth and Reset keep working while the mouse is held. At full strength the surface moves about `strength × (1 + radius)` m/s at the brush centre, fading out toward the edge.

The brush axis is the surface normal by default. World up and view direction are options.

## Paint layers

| Layer | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Auto** | The terrain's own layers above the original surface, dug soil below it. Painting Auto erases paint. |
| **Terrain layers** | Every layer of the zone's terrain (up to 16), shown with its texture. |
| **Dug Soil** | The zone's underground material. |

## Controls

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Hold or drag | Apply the brush |
| Shift / Ctrl (held) | Add / Smooth |
| A + drag left or right | Brush size |
| S + drag left or right | Brush strength |
| `[` `]` | Brush size: a tap changes it by 10%, holding the key keeps shrinking or growing it |

## Undo and the runtime

Every stroke is one undo step. Undo and redo remesh only the chunks the stroke changed, and zones whose terrain the undo didn't touch aren't re-synced, so they stay quick on large zones. In a VRChat project, the stroke is copied into the zone's `DigZoneRuntime` when you release the mouse, so the uploaded world starts with your sculpting.
